## Projects

### 1. Airdrop Comparison (Arbitrum and Optimism): Flipside vs. Dune Analytics
**Description:** I analyzed two airdropsâ€”Arbitrum (March 23, 2023) and Optimism (May 31, 2022)â€”to evaluate their impact on transactions and user adoption, using Flipside Crypto and Dune Analytics to compare the results obtained from both platforms.

**Tools:** Flipside Crypto, Dune Analytics, SQL

**Methodology:**
- My goal was to replicate the same dashboard on both platforms to compare their functionality.
- I queried different datasets in Flipside and Dune to achieve consistent results.
- I analyzed the differences in how each platform handles and presents data.

**Results:**
- Both dashboards displayed similar results, with a few exceptions.
- The main difference was in the token price evolution: Flipside captures more extreme price points, while Dune uses averages, smoothing out fluctuations.
- Conclusion: Both platforms are effective, but their data handling approaches differ, impacting the interpretation of metrics like price.

**Deliverables:**
- [Flipside Dashboard](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/andeleya/airdrop-comparison-o5RkdI)
- [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/andeleya/airdropcomparisonadl)
- [Flipside SQL Query](flipside_airdrop.sql)
- [Dune SQL Query](dune_airdrop.sql)

**Reflection:** This project taught me the strengths and limitations of Flipside and Dune. Flipside is more intuitive for quick visualizations, while Dune offers greater flexibility for advanced analysis. In the future, I plan to dive deeper into price analysis by integrating more detailed historical data.

## Future Projects
- Track the destinations of tokens distributed in the Arbitrum and Optimism airdrops to analyze transfer patterns.
