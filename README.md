## Projects

### 1. Airdrop Comparison (Arbitrum and Optimism): Flipside vs. Dune Analytics
**Description:** I analyzed two airdrops—Arbitrum (March 23, 2023) and Optimism (May 31, 2022)—to evaluate their impact on transactions and user adoption, using Flipside Crypto and Dune Analytics to compare the results obtained from both platforms.

**Tools:** Flipside Crypto, Dune Analytics, SQL

**Methodology:**
- My goal was to replicate the same dashboard on both platforms to compare their functionality.
- I queried different datasets in Flipside and Dune to achieve consistent results.
- I analyzed the differences in how each platform handles and presents data.

**Results:**
- Both dashboards displayed similar results, with a few exceptions.
- The main difference was in the token price evolution: Flipside captures more extreme price points, while Dune uses averages, smoothing out fluctuations.
- Conclusion: Both platforms are effective, but their data handling approaches differ, impacting the interpretation of metrics like price.

**Deliverables:**

**Reflection:** This project taught me the strengths and limitations of Flipside and Dune. Flipside is more intuitive for quick visualizations, while Dune offers greater flexibility for advanced analysis. In the future, I plan to dive deeper into price analysis by integrating more detailed historical data.

## Future Projects
- Track the destinations of tokens distributed in the Arbitrum and Optimism airdrops to analyze transfer patterns.
- Analyze swap volume on Uniswap to understand post-airdrop activity.
- Explore fund flows in stablecoins like USDC to identify trends in DeFi.
